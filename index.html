      <h4>About us</h4>
      <div>
        Lucy is an experienced primary school teacher who is now on a mission to share her joy of yoga with even more children.   Lucy knows first hand, the positive impact of yoga on children, during her time as a classroom teacher, she always made time for yoga because she knew it could teach them skills of self-regulation, focus, empathy and strength.  But of course, none of this would have gone down well with the children unless it was FUN (which it truly is … silly at times too!)   It is for this reason that Lucy left mainstream teaching with a vision to bring this joyful, empowering practise to as many children as possible!  Alongside her teaching qualifications, Lucy is now a certified Kids Yoga Teacher.  With a wealth of experience of working with children, Lucy understands the developmental goals of nursery and primary aged children and now alongside her in depth yoga training, children taking part in Pyramid Adventures have an enthusiastic, caring, and knowledgeable teacher.

      <h4>Why we love yoga!</h4>
      <div>   
        Here are our top 10 benefits for kids yoga (there are so many more but then we’d never finish writing this page!)
        <ul class="centred-list">
          <li>Helps to develop muscle tone and strength throughout the body, supporting joints.</li>
          <li>Builds core strength which helps develop good posture and overall good levels of physical fitness.</li>
          <li>Supports and strengthens the immune system by reducing stress and stimulating the lymph system.</li>
          <li>Yoga can accommodate all shapes and sizes and is not competitive, so it’s a fabulous form of exercise without the pressure of competition.</li>
          <li>Increases attention span and improves concentration through our story structure.  With our children growing up in this digital era, it is more important than ever to teach our children skills of concentration and perseverance.</li>
          <li>Children build self-confidence because they can do yoga, they become braver, aspiring to the characters and role models in our stories.</li>
          <li>Children deal better with anxiety, stress and conflict because they learn to use relaxation and breathing techniques into their day to day life.</li>
          <li>Improves relationships and social awareness through role playing in stories.</li>
          <li>Encourages joy and positive outlooks with fun stories and joyful experiences in yoga sessions.</li>

          As suggested in our name, yoga with Pyramid Adventures is an adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          We start each session with a warm up, ensuring that our bodies are ready for the adventure ahead.
          Lucy tells the story, which she brings to life with yoga postures.  Each time she does a posture, the rest of the children join her.
          The story comes to an end with a few moments of relaxation, it is the time to reflect on the adventure we’ve had and think about any morals or lessons we can learn.
          Once we’ve finished our relaxation, we will come together for a quick game before we come to the end of our session.
